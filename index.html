     <p>Amritsar, founded in 1577 by Guru Ram Das, is a city rich in history and cultural significance, known primarily for the Golden Temple, the holiest site in Sikhism.
Founding and Early History
Amritsar was established by Sri Guru Ram Das Ji, the fourth Sikh Guru, in 1577. The area was initially covered with dense forests and lakes. Guru Ram Das invited 52 traders from nearby regions to settle in the city, leading to the establishment of the first shops, known as Batisi Hatta. The city was originally called Ramdaspur, named after the Guru, and it is mentioned in the Guru Granth Sahib. The construction of the Amrit Sarovar (Pool of Nectar), which gives the city its name, was initiated by Guru Ram Das and completed by his successor, Guru Arjan Dev Ji, who also built the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) at its center.

Sikh Empire and Cultural Development
The city became a significant center for Sikhism, especially during the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in the early 19th century. Ranjit Singh unified the Sikh Misls (confederacies) and fortified Amritsar, enhancing its infrastructure and cultural prominence. He covered the upper part of the Golden Temple with gold, giving it its iconic appearance. Under his rule, Amritsar flourished as a major trading hub and cultural center, attracting merchants and artists from various regions.
